ECON7030 Descriptive Research Part II- Report
Task In an empirical   project   the   research question is answered   by formulating a   hypothesis and   testing   this   hypothesis   using   appropriate   data   and   relevant   statistical   techniques.   In   this   assignment,   you   will   focus   on data  descriptive research. Accordingly, you will:
1.   State your research hypothesis.
2. Describe the data relevant   for testing your research hypothesis.
3. Clean and process the data. Construct the relevant variables. Provide a   clear   description   of   relevant   variables.
4. Create a table of   summary statistics (or   a   chart)   following your OP/or report   chapter.
5. Interpret the results reported in the relevant table (or chart).

SECTION 1: Research QUESTION AND A clear and concise DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA/SAMPLE 
Step   1. Clearly state your research question and hypothesis.
Step 2. Describe the data/sample (following   YOUR OP). At the least, you must state the following: 
√ Data   source   (name   of   the   survey) (e.g.,   IPUMS,   CPS,   HILDA)
√ Survey   Location   (e.g., Nigeria)
√ Data   source   (name   of   the   survey)   [e.g.,   DHS].
√ Sampling strategy (e.g., describe relevant sampling   strategy/survey design –   available   in   the   data   sites)
√ What information was collected in the survey? (e.g., DHS provides representative data   on population, health, HIV, and nutrition at the household level/ individual level   (for women   and   men   aged   15-49 years   old, and   for   children   aged   0-14   years). 
√ Year   of   study   (e.g., “I   … used   cross   section   data   for   2008   for   Nigeria.”      Or   I   used   panel   data   from 20 waves   of   HILDA   – 2002-2020).
√ Which   sample   are   you   using? (I   am   using   DHS   Women’s   sample).
√ What   is   your   unit   of   analysis? (Individual? Household? Country?)   [e.g., I   obtained   individual-level anthropometric and sociodemographic data for women of   reproductive age:      15-49 years   old].
√   Sampling   size   (e.g.,   The   Nigerian   component   contains   responses   from   7,000–35,000   women   in each   year. I   used   a   sample   of   10,746 women)
√   Study   design:   cross   section,   panel,   repeated   cross   section,   time   series   (e.g.,   study   design   for   my   research is repeated cross   section).
Note: Clearly indicate if   your replication data is different from/or   similar to   OP data.
[Don’t worry if this section substantially overlaps with A3]
Section 2. DaTA Mining, Variable construction and description of key variables. 
i. How did you clean and process the data to construct the relevant variables? 
Describe how you cleaned the raw data to construct the relevant variables (here you   dicuss how you   dealt   with missing values, outliers, no-response questions etc.).
ii. Clearly describe the relevant variables of your proposed empirical analysis. 
Key variables. For example: equivalisedhousehold measures of income, consumption, wealth. 
For   journal papers, discuss how you constructed the key independent variable, dependent /control variables.   For example:
the key outcome variable (dependent variable) of interest in 
my proposed model is whether an individual is 
overweight/or obese. “i divided body wei代 写ECON7030 Descriptive Research Part IIStatistics

squared to calculate each individual’s body mass index 
(bmi) and transformed this into a dichotomous indicator of 
whether an individual had a bmi above pre-established 
overweight and obese thresholds set by the world health 
organization (who 2015) based on risks to cardiovascular 
health: 25 kg/m2 (overweight or obese) and 30 kg/m2 
(obese)” (Barlow, 2021). 
Key explanatory variable.   For   example: the key explanatory variable in my model is ‘expected years of schooling’ measured by number of years of schooling completed by an individual at the time of the survey 
(based   on   DHS   variable   v133) (Barlow, 2021).Key control variables. For   example:   “I control for individual level characteristics such as age, income, occupation;family background characteristics, and dummy variables for regions in Nigeria” (Barlow, 2021)   For variable descriptions see the table of   summary statistics reported in   the next   section.
SECTION 3. Report CHARTS/summary statistics of variables 
You will replicate a chart (from the report) or the table   of   summary   statistics   from your OP.
• If   you are directly using OP data (same sample/setting/time-period), then simply reproduce the   table   from   OP.
If   you are using a different sample /different setting/or time-period), then report   the   summary   statistics using your sample.
You   must:
√ Clearly label tables and figures, adding appropriate notes to make   it   clear what variables   are   included   and how they are constructed.
√ Present tables and figures professionally. Use relevant Stata codes (e.g., esttab / outreg /putexcel commands and/or graph export commands for figures) to produce tables/figures. DONOT copy-   paste   Stata output directly into the body of   the assignment.
√ Figures, tables, and graphs should   be informative and self-explanatory.
SECTION 4. Discussion/Interpretation of results 
Interpret the table or the figure you have reported above. The discussion must refer to   the broader   literature   where relevant.
Here’s an example of   a table of   summary statistics   following Barlow   (2021).“Table    1 summarizes    their demographic and anthropometric characteristics.    On    average, 33.6% of the sample was overweight or obese across all survey years. This number is slightly higher than the proportion reported in previous    analyses    of    DHS data,    which    likely    reflects    the    slightly    older    age    of    my    sample (Kampala   and   Stranges   2014; Neupane   et   al. 2015). ” 
Here’s an example of   a chart from a report   (Productivity   Commission,   2024).
Figure 2.5 – The effects of COVID 19 on households varied across the distribution. 
Annual   change   in   equivalised   household   disposable   income   by   decile, 2018-19 to   2021   22“Job    losses    at    the start    of    the pandemic meant that labour income for the bottom decile decreased significantly. Yet substantial government support payments led to large increases in the disposable incomes of lowincome households relative to middle and higherincome households, leading to an initial decline in overall income inequality (figure 2.5, 2018-19 to 2019-20). In particular, recipients of JobSeeker initially received an additional $550 per fortnight under the Coronavirus Supplement, almost doubling the previous size of the payment (AIHW 2021,pp. 84–85). ”
